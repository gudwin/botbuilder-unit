--------------------------------
v 0.4.0
HIGHLIGHTS:
- [OK]colored output (disabled by default);
- [OK] ability to setup test timeout globally
- [NO]session state management support;
- [NO]support for random messages;
- [NO]debugging steps added: showSession, showDialogStack
- [NO]support for conversation started by bot

--------------------------------
v 0.3.0

- [OK] callbacks changed to Promises
- [OK] support for test timeout;

INCOMPATIBILITIES

- new list of arguments for "before" and "after" callbacks: config, bot;
- "before" and "after" should return a promise which will resolve or reject a current step;
- "user" and "bot" in case, if they are callbacks, should return promise, callback removed from arguments


Changes: new  attribute for testing function - options:
             unit(bot, script, options );
options = {
    timeout : value
}
- int timeout, by default equal to 60000, zero value equals to infinity.
  Fails the test, if time since the test started exceeds the value of attribute;
