--------------------------------
v 0.4.7
- support for suggestedActions;

--------------------------------
v 0.4.0
HIGHLIGHTS:
- [OK]colored output (disabled by default);
- [OK] callbacks changed to Promises
- [OK] support for test timeout;
- [OK] new output log;





Requirement Description:
- To be able to produce output in different modes:
-- short,
-- detail,
-- beauty, mode when the Library with try to simulate UI of a chat messenger, messages will be wrapped in colors
- To get rid of logging dependency
- To be able to specify output mode for a standalone test;
- To be able to setup default output mode globally

Actions required:
- Identify cases for output
- For cases provide a base adapter class
-
The way how the Library produces output has to be changed as current state overloaded with information.


--------------------------------
v 0.3.0

INCOMPATIBILITIES

- new list of arguments for "before" and "after" callbacks: config, bot;
- "before" and "after" should return a promise which will resolve or reject a current step;
- "user" and "bot" in case, if they are callbacks, should return promise, callback removed from arguments


Changes: new  attribute for testing function - options:
             unit(bot, script, options );
options = {
    timeout : value
}
- int timeout, by default equal to 60000, zero value equals to infinity.
  Fails the test, if time since the test started exceeds the value of attribute;
